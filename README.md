# Android Music Service Example (Java)

This is a simple Android project built using Java to demonstrate the use of **Android Services**. It includes two buttons:

- **Start Music Service**
- **Stop Music Service**

When the user taps "Start", background music begins to play using a foreground `Service`. When "Stop" is pressed, the service stops and the music is halted.
